for recommender system we should make two neural networks to predict content item data and content user data and these arrays should be in the same shape.
As always we are gonna scale our data so it gets faster as it trains the neural network.
this data has 600 users and 9000 movies so our training dataset has something about 54000 rows.
you can see a picture of how this system actually works.
at the end of the code , we will make a user and recommend him some movies from our movie list.
